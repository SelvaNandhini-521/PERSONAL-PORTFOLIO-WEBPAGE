# PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-WEBPAGE

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

This Personal Portfolio Website is a clean, responsive, and modern single-page application developed using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript (for interactivity, if extended). It was created with the goal of showcasing the developer’s projects, skills, and personal brand in an organized and visually appealing way. The site belongs to Selva Nandhini, a passionate frontend developer and current 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student.

The tools used in building this website are:

HTML5: for creating the structure and content of the page.

CSS3: for designing the layout, colors, responsiveness, and animations.

Responsive Design Techniques: including Flexbox and Grid for layout management and media queries for adaptability on different screen sizes.

(Optional for future improvements: JavaScript or frameworks like React.js can be used to add interactive components such as a project filter or contact form validation.)

Website Structure
The website is organized into several key sections:

Header & Navigation
The header includes a sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the page while scrolling. The navigation links — Home, Projects, About, and Contact — allow smooth scrolling to different sections of the same page. The nav bar uses hover effects to make the user interface feel more interactive and professional.

Home Section (Hero Banner)
The homepage begins with a welcoming message:
"Hey, I'm Selva Nandhini"
It introduces the developer with a short subtitle stating their role as an aspiring frontend developer and student. A call-to-action button labeled "Explore Projects" invites users to browse through her work. The background uses a soft linear gradient that gives a pleasant and modern look.

Projects Section
This section highlights some of the key projects developed by Selva Nandhini. Each project is presented within a card layout, making it easy to scan. Some of the featured projects include:

Portfolio Website – the current site being showcased.

Login Page UI – a modern form with validation and animations.

E-commerce Product Grid – a flexible and responsive catalog interface.

Weather App UI – an API-ready frontend interface.

Makeup Ordering Website – a full e-commerce form with JavaScript validation.

Event Ticketing System (Java) – a backend-integrated Java desktop app using Swing and JDBC.

The cards have hover effects that add depth and interactivity, enhancing user engagement.

About Me Section
This section introduces the developer more personally. It talks about her journey as a Computer Science Engineering student, her passion for frontend development, and her interest in user interface design and modern web technologies.

Contact Section
A simple and elegant contact section provides a way for visitors to reach out. It includes an email link (angelnandhini05@gmail.com) and a location note (Tamil Nadu, India). The section uses a soft blue gradient background, aligning visually with the overall design theme.

Footer
A minimal footer concludes the page with a copyright notice:

Design and Responsiveness
The website uses a consistent color scheme of soft blues and whites, giving it a clean and calm aesthetic. Elements like buttons and headers use shades of navy and light gradients to maintain a cohesive visual style.

Responsiveness is a major feature of this portfolio. The layout adapts gracefully to all screen sizes using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries. On smaller devices, the navigation transforms into a vertical list, ensuring the UI remains intuitive and easy to navigate.

Conclusion
This personal portfolio is more than just a website; it's a digital identity. It showcases not only the technical skills of the developer but also their attention to detail, design sense, and user experience knowledge. The clean code structure, responsive design, and focus on usability make it a solid frontend project suitable for academic, internship, or job applications.
